## Piip

Send the private IP address of a Raspberry PI 
(or any linux machine for that matter) per SMS to a phone.

You might want to chose to run `send.py` at machine startup
so you know with which IP to connect to it.

## Install
- Clone this repository
- make build
- ./send

## Requirements 
- A twilio account (free account is sufficient) with a phone number that can send outgoing messaged.
- A target phone of course.
